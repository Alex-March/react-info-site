This is my first react project, the goal of which is to build a simple React info site, based on an
alreadfy given Figma design, using React. The Figma design can be found using the following link:
https://www.figma.com/file/xA1rJVQOorqMW6xjGdBLcI/ReactFacts?node-id=0%3A1

To run the code, first make sure you have node and npm installed (can type in "node -v" and "npm-v"
into a command prompt and if they return a version, it means you have it installed)

Once you cloned the repo, make sure you're in the parent folder: cd react-info-site Make sure you
have the associated packages with the app: npm install To run the app: npm run dev

The command prompt should then provide a URL that you can enter into your browser, which should look
something like this: ➜ Local: http://localhost:5173/

And voilà! The app should be up and running.

Thank you for checking out my first React app!
